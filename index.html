               <h2>It's a long way to go...</h2>
               <p>I've taken a few trips to West Texas, for work and play, most recently with my spouse. I'd like to share a few of the reasons I think this is a special place with you, along with pictures!</p>

                     To cross Texas from Orange to El Paso is just a hair longer than the drive from St Louis to Denver.

               <h2>The Menger Hotel</h2>
               <p>Built in 1859, right next to the Spanish Mission (the "Alamo"), this boarding house has hosted Native Americans, presidents, poets, actors, generals, singers and the public of the world.</p>
