               <p>I've taken a few trips to West Texas, for work and play, most recently with my better half.
                  I'd like to share a few of the reasons I think this is a special place with you, along with pictures!</p>
               <h2>It's a long way to go...</h2>
               <p>To cross Texas from Orange to El Paso is just a hair longer than the drive from St Louis to Denver.</p>
